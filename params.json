An approach to handling MI data is propositionalisation, where each bag is converted into single feature vector, which can then be used with standard learning algorithms such as SVMs and Neural Networks.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to explore adaptive propositionalisation, where the propositionalisation process adapts to the specific single instance learner being used. Application of this technique to the image classification problem have also been considered.\r\n\r\n## Turing Machine Verifier ##\r\nSource: http://github.com/smanoharan/235-lab-verifier/\r\n\r\nCurrently hosted at: http://comp235labs.herokuapp.com\r\n\r\n\r\nAn online automatic verifier for the Turing Machines in COMP235 Labs.\r\nWritten in Java using the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/).\r\nIndividual side project, developed for use by the students of COMP235: Logic and Computation.\r\n\r\nSupported features:\r\n* Allows testing each machine with an arbitrary number of test inputs.\r\n* Checks for Non-Determinism, Tape-OutOfBound errors and Alphabet constraints.\r\n* Shows an overall summary of results.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# 2011 #\r\n\r\n## Fix Set Quasi Order Generator ##\r\nSource: https://github.com/smanoharan/fix-set-quasi-order-generator/\r\n\r\nA software package for generating all fix-orders of any given group (the abstract algebraic structure) and visualising the lattice of all fix-orders as a Hasse diagram. \r\nA project developed for 2011/2012 summer research work.\r\n\r\nResults are hosted at: http://www.math.waikato.ac.nz/~stokes/data/\r\n\r\n\r\n## Kinect Sign Language Learner ##\r\nSource: http://github.com/smanoharan/314Kinect/\r\n\r\nA group project, developed for COMP314: Software Engineering Project.\r\nAllows instructors to teach signs to the software, which in turn can evaluate students on their performance of the same sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse Case:\r\n1. Instructors train any sign (or any arbitrary gesture) by performing the sign a few (5 or so) times to the software (in record mode).\r\n2. The software then \"learns\" the sign (by modelling the sign via Hidden Markov Models) and saves it to disk.\r\n3. A student performs the learned sign to the software (in evaluate mode).\r\n4. The software gives feedback (a score out of 10) to the student, based on how well the student performance matched that of the instructor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors:\r\n* Sidd Arora (@siddarora)\r\n* William Lam (@davanish)\r\n* Siva Manoharan (@smanoharan)\r\n* Mark Will (@maw41)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# 2010 #\r\n\r\n## Top Gear Electrified ##\r\nSource: http://github.com/smanoharan/242XNA/\r\n\r\n\r\nA group project, developed for COMP242: Software Engineering Process.\r\nA multiplayer on-rails 3D car Racing simulation, developed in C#, using the XNA framework.\r\n\r\nSupported Features:\r\n* 3D cars, tracks and realistic physics.\r\n* Network and local-machine (split-screen) multiplayer support.\r\n* Engine and background audio.\r\n* Particle effects, Bloom Lighting, HD skybox.\r\n\r\nAuthors:\r\n* Sidd Arora (@siddarora)\r\n* Siva Manoharan (@smanoharan)\r\n* Adrian Shaw (@ashawnz)\r\n* Martin Poot\r\n\r\n# 2009 #\r\n\r\n## 3D Spacecraft Simulator ##\r\nIndividual side project, developed for learning XNA and 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nLanguages: C# (using the XNA framework).\r\n\r\nSource: TODO\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# 2008 #\r\n\r\n## Tactical Wargame ##\r\nA 2-player turn-based strategy game.\r\n\r\nLanguages: Visual Basic (using the DirectX framework).\r\n\r\nSource: Download from TODO\r\n\r\nTODO","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
